# Harris-corner-detector-with-SIFT-descriptor
Feature extraction by Harris corner algorithm and SIFT descriptor for matching features of images.
Here three methods are used to match the features (corner) of images.
1) SSD (Sum of squared differences) 2) NCC ( Normalized cross-correlation) 3) SIFT descriptor
SIFT descriptor is scale and rotation invariant.
Run main.m for SSD and NCC.
Run either decriptor.m or descriptor2.m for SIFT.
Further improvement can be done in SIFT.
